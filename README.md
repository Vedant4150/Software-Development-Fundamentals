Bouncing Ball Animation
This project demonstrates a simple bouncing ball animation using Python's turtle graphics library. It showcases basic computer graphics programming concepts such as animation loops, boundary collision detection, and user interactions through keyboard input.

Features
Animation Control: The animation runs smoothly and allows the user to exit by pressing the 'q' key.
Collision Detection: The ball bounces back when hitting the boundaries of the window, simulating wall collision.
Performance Optimized: Implements screen.tracer(0) to optimize the rendering of the animation.
Prerequisites
Before running this project, you must have Python installed on your computer. The project uses Python's built-in turtle module, so no additional libraries are required.
